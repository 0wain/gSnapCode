# gSnapCode
Allow your players to share their snapchat with the server

The idea behind this is to allow users to inpuit their snapchat names into a library of other snapchat names that anyone on the server can access. It's a way for users to socially share their snapchatnames through inputting their snapchat and having their snapcodes be presented on a list.

Users input their snapcht in the register page and it auto updates on a database. All users are then also updated so they have up to date lists. A user can only have 1 snapchat linked to their account at a time. This prevents them spamming the list.

The addon also uses a cache system that saves the snapcodes to the users data folder so they only ever need to load the snapcode once and it will forever load from their data folder after that
